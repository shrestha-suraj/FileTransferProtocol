## FileTransferProtocol

### IDE Used: Ecplise for Java Developers

### Description:
This file transfer protocl is created with intention of providing a command line UI for sharing files. For the test purpose of the application, the server folder and user folder has been created. These folders have certain files and some other folders inside them. Upon running the code, user are asked to log in. The login detail can be found on the user_db.txt file. Incorrect login will prompt you back to login page. After successful login, the user has ability to download the files from server. In this case the file gets copied to the user folder and same concept is applied for the upload process. This is not just a copy paste process but rather data transfer from one port to another. One of the port is being used by Server.java and the other is being run by Client.java.
